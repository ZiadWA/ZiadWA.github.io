<br>
I'm a male minor from Egypt. I'm an operating system fanatic, specifically for Microsoft Windows and Linux.
I use legacy, old hardware.
I'm a Windows user since 2010 and a Linux user since June 2019.
I'm usually known for tweeting my experiences with software, and probably gaming and Anime.
Oh! I'm also a Momo Yaoyorozu stan in progress!
